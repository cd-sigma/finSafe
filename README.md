# FinSafe - Crypto Asset Health Tracking and Protection Platform

## Overview

FinSafe is a comprehensive platform designed to monitor and safeguard the health of crypto assets borrowed from various
lending platforms, such as Maker, Aave, Compound, and more. The primary goal of FinSafe is to prevent the liquidation of
